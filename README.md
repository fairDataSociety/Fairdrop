# Readme - Fairdrop

## About Fairdrop

Fairdrop is a free, decentralised, private and secure file transfer dapp contributed to Fair Data Society by Datafund. It is the first blockchain product based on Fair Data Society principles. This means that Fairdrop completely respects your privacy and doesn’t need or collect any personal data. It runs on the Ethereum network and uses Swarm’s decentralised storage system for file storing and sending. This means:

- No central servers.
- No tracking.
- No backdoors.

It also comes with a built-in 256-bit ECDSA signature algorithm and the ability.

An official hosted beta version of Fairdrop is available for you at fairdrop.xyz - it's free to use and all of your data is encrypted before it leaves your browser!

You are also able to run your own copy of the code which you may download from the [github repository](http://github.com/fairDataSociety/Fairdrop)
